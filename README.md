# GUI-Based-P2P-Simulation
Peer-to-peer systems can be of a very large scale such as millions of nodes, which typically join and leave continously. These properties are very challenging to deal with. Evaluating a new protocol in a real environment, especially in its early stages of development, is not feasible.
